System Programming in Python
---

The goal of this seminar is to practice in using Pythons that manage facilities
provided by the operation system. 

1. Using the [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) and
   [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) modules to run programs from Python scripts.

   Read documentation on the `os.path.realpath(path)`, `os.system(command)`, `sys.executable`,
   and `sys.argv` methods.

   Study [this](15-57_dorun.py) example and run it:
   
       python3 15-57_dorun.py 15-58_torun.py qwe ert ert


See the programs in Python [here](.).
