## Welcome to Computer Architecture and Operating Systems

This site contains materials for the "Computer Architecture and Operating Systems" course taught at
[Faculty of Computer Science of Higher School of Economics](https://cs.hse.ru/en/).

For information on course administration, please refer to the
official course [page](http://wiki.cs.hse.ru/ACOS_DSBA_2019/2020) at the HSE web site.
Official syllabus can be found [here](https://www.hse.ru/edu/courses/301394490).

### Course Motivation

This course is taught to second-year students who major in [data science](https://www.hse.ru/en/ba/data/).
The goal of the course is to give an introduction to how operating systems and hardware work under the hood,
which is essential for general computer science literacy.
This will help better understand the performance of software systems.
Also, the course will give the necessary background to those who are planning to apply machine learning methods
in system software (most of top-ranked IT companies have such projects).
The practical part gives some experience in working with system software such as Unix-based operating systems,
compilers, build tools, emulators, virtual machines, and so on.
