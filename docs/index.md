# Welcome to Computer Architecture and Operating Systems

This site contains materials for the "Computer Architecture and Operating Systems" course taught at
[Faculty of Computer Science of Higher School of Economics](https://cs.hse.ru/en/).

For information on course administration, please refer to the
official course [page](http://wiki.cs.hse.ru/ACOS_DSBA_2019/2020) at the university web site.
The official syllabus can be found [here](https://www.hse.ru/edu/courses/301394490).

## Course Motivation

This course is taught to second-year students who major in [data science](https://www.hse.ru/en/ba/data/).
The goal of the course is to give an introduction to how operating systems and hardware work under the hood,
which is essential for general computer science literacy.
This knowledge will help better understand the performance of software systems and create more efficient solutions.
Also, the course will give a starting background to those who are planning to apply machine learning methods
in system software (most of top-ranked IT companies have such projects).
The practical part will give some experience in working with system software such as Unix-based operating systems,
compilers, build tools, emulators, virtual machines, and so on. 

## Course Description

__TODO: CONTENT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT__ 

The course consists of two logical parts.
The first part is given in __module 3__ and is dedicated to computer architecture and assembly language programming.
The second part is given in __module 4__ and covers foundations of operating system organisation and system programming.
