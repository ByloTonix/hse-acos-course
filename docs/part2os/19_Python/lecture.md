# High-level Languages and Operating System.

## Lecture

### OS and Programming Languages

#### Linux:

* Kernel — C
* Core system libraries — C
* Core system utilities — mostly C and shell
  * Can be C++, Python and Perl
* Scripting and integrating
  * Mostly shell, but Perl _was_ popular and Python _is_ now
  * Sometimes C++
* Almost any OS distribution — ''all'' kinds of programming languages

⇒ Is C the only system programming language?

#### Windows:

* Core, kernel and libraries: C++ (seldom C)
* Scripting and integrating:
  * Any .Net-based platform (mostly C#)
  * C++
  * Powershell (was: cmd)
  * JScript, VBScript (Windows Script Host)
* Applications: C++, .Net, almost any 3d-party languages

#### MacOS:

* Kernel — C
* Core system and libraries — [Objective C](
  https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)
  and C, seldom C++
  * Now: [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift)
* Scripting and integration: [AppleScript](
  https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/AppleScriptX.html)
  and Shell
* Applications: Swift, Objective C, maybe C++, almost any 3d-party languages
