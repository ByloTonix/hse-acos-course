Exam Topics for Year 2021/2022
---

### Exam Rules

* The exam is oral: 40 minutes for a preparation and 10 minutes for an answer.
* No materials are allowed except for [RISC-V Greencard](
  https://github.com/andrewt0301/hse-acos-course/raw/master/related/greencard-20181213.pdf).
* Exam tickets include 3 questions:
  1. theoretical question on CA;
  2. theoretical question on OS;
  3. programming task (solved on a sheet of paper).

__HINT__:
An answer to each question is expected to take ~ 3 minutes.
Theoretical questions contain a number of points (subquestions).
For many of them, a simple answer (1 sentence) is enough.
The exam checks your overall understanding of main concepts.

#### Grading

__Grade = 0.3 * Theory_CA + 0.3 * Theory_OS + 0.4 * Programming__
