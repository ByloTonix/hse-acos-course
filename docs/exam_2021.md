Exam Topics for Year 2021/2022
---

### Exam Rules

* The exam is oral: 40 minutes for a preparation and 10 minutes for an answer. 
* No materials are allowed except for [RISC-V Greencard](
  https://github.com/andrewt0301/hse-acos-course/raw/master/related/greencard-20181213.pdf).
* Exam tickets includes 3 questions: 2 theoretical (CA and OS) and 1 programming task.
* Programming task is solved on a sheet of paper.

__Grade = 0.3 * Theory_CA + 0.3 * Theory_OS + 0.4 * Programming__
