## Lecture

Slides ([PDF](CA_Lecture_11.pdf), [PPTX](CA_Lecture_11.pptx)).

#### Outline:

* Processor-memory performance gap
* Types of memory devices
* Principle of locality and memory hierarchy
* Cache memory (direct-mapped, set-associative, fully-associative)
* Writing and replacement policies
* Multi-level caches
* Performance considerations

#### Examples

Linear memory accesses:

```assembly
    .eqv  START 0x10010000
    .eqv  SZ    512
    .text
    li    s0, START
    addi  s1, s0, SZ
loop:
    lw    t0, 0(s0)
    addi  s0, s0, 4
    blt   s0, s1, loop
```

Gapped memory accesses:

```assembly
    .eqv  START 0x10010000
    .eqv  HSZ   256
    # Direct mapping burns out
    # Associative captures
    .text
    li    s0, START
    addi  s1, s0, HSZ
    mv    s2, s1
loop:
    lw    t0, 0(s0)
    lw    t1, 0(s1)
    addi  s0, s0, 4
    addi  s1, s1, 4
    blt   s0, s2, loop
```

Equidistance (try to vary step):

```assembly
    .eqv  START 0x10010000
    .eqv  SZ    256
    .eqv  GAP   3   # Try 5, 11
    .text

    li    s0, START  # start address
    addi  s1, s0, SZ # end address
    li    s2, GAP    # gap in words
    slli  s3, s2, 2  # gap in bytes

    mv    t0, zero
loop_gap:
    slli  t1, t0, 2
    add   t1, s0, t1
loop:
    lw    t2, 0(t1)
 
    add   t1, t1, s3
    blt   t1, s1, loop

    addi  t0, t0, 1
    blt   t0, s2, loop_gap
```

#### Tasks

1. Find the AMAT for a processor with a 1 ns clock cycle time, a miss penalty of 20 clock cycles,
   a miss rate of 0.05 misses per instruction, and a cache access time (including hit detection) of 1 clock cycle.
   Assume that the read and write miss penalties are the same and ignore other write stalls.

1. Assuming a cache of 4096 blocks, a four-word block size, and a 64-bit address,
   find the total number of sets and the total number of tag bits for caches that are
   direct-mapped two-way and four-way set associative, and fully associative.

1. Try the above examples with following cache configurations (`Tool | Data Cache Simulator`).

   * Placement policy: Direct Mapping / Fully Associative / 2-Way associative
   * Block replacement policy: LRU / Random

   `2Ã—3=6` experiments in total. Report the cache hit rate.

1. Write a program that utilizes memory sparsely, so that its footprint is 100% misses 2-way associative cache.
   However, it fits (almost) into a 4-way associative cache with 16 blocks.

## Homework

Finish all the tasks.
