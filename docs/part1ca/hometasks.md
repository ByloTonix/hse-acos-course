Home Tasks

Here are assembly programming tasks, which were given during the previous year.
They are enough. However, they were somewhat challenging for some students.

# Task Descriptions

1. ###### DoubleSum

   Enter four integers, one in line, and add uniconditionally first one to third one, and second one to fourth one.
   Print results in two lines.

   Input:
   ```
   234
   -23
   23
   64
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   257
   41
   ```

1. ###### DigitSum

   Input an integer (can be negative), and output sum of its digits.

   Input:
   ```
   -12345
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   15
   ```

1. ###### PlusMinus

   Input a cardinal N, then input N integers a(i); output the result of a(0)-a(1)+a(2)-...Â±a(N-1).

   Input:
   ```
   4
   22
   13
   14
   15
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   8
   ```

1. ###### EvenBack

   Input a cardinal N, then N integers. Output line by line only even ones, in reversed order.

   Input:
   ```
   6
   12
   -11
   3
   88
   0
   1
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   0
   88
   12
   ```

1. ###### NoDups

   Input a cardinal N, then N integers. Output all the integers, skipping duplicated ones.

   Input:
   ```
   8
   12
   34
   -12
   23
   12
   -12
   56
   9
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   12
   34
   -12
   23
   56
   9
   ```

1. ###### CheckTriangles

   Write a subroutine check, which inputs 3 integers and checks if they can form a triangle (a=b+c is valid).
   Subroutine returns 1 if they can. 2 if not, and 0 if they were 0, 0, 0.
   Write a program that calls check and prints 'Y' on 1, or 'N' on 2, until check returns 0; then program must exit.

   Input:
   ```
   1
   2
   3
   4
   5
   6
   1
   4
   8
   0
   0
   0
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Y
   Y
   N
   ```

1. ###### FuncSort

   Write a program, that inputs N, then N numbers, and then outputs them sorted in one line.
   You may need to write a sort subroutine, but it is not mandatory here.

   Input:
   ```
   5
   -123
   34
   546
   0
   -100500
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   -100500 -123 0 34 546
   ```

1. ###### RecursiveGCD

   Write a program that inputs two numbers and output its' [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor).
   You must write a recursive subroutine gcd to complete this task.

   Input:
   ```
   2467080
   49360080
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   9240
   ```

1. ###### LeftDigits

   Write a program that inputs a cardinal N, an then inputs N numbers (may be negative).
   After that it outputs only first digits of these numbers (in one line).
   You are inclined to write a subroutine "first", that accepts a number (via $a0) and returns last digit (via $v0).

   Input:
   ```
   5
   -2345
   7345623
   -4321
   2 
   7543
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   27427
   ```
