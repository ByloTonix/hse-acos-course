Home Tasks
---

Here are assembly programming tasks, which were given during the previous year.
They are enough. However, they were somewhat challenging for some students. 

1. PlusMinus

   Input a cardinal N, then input N integers a(i); output the result of a(0)-a(1)+a(2)-...Â±a(N-1).

   Input:
   ```
   4
   22
   13
   14
   15
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   8
   ```

1. EvenBack

   Input a cardinal N, then N integers. Output line by line only even ones, in reversed order.

   Input:
   ```
   6
   12
   -11
   3
   88
   0
   1
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   0
   88
   12
   ```

1. NoDups

   Input a cardinal N, then N integers. Output all the integers, skipping duplicated ones.

   Input:
   ```
   8
   12
   34
   -12
   23
   12
   -12
   56
   9
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   12
   34
   -12
   23
   56
   9
   ```

1. CheckTriangles

1. FuncSort

   Write a program, that inputs N, then N numbers, and then outputs them sorted in one line.
   You may need to write a sort subroutine, but it is not mandatory here.

   Input:
   ```
   5
   -123
   34
   546
   0
   -100500
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   -100500 -123 0 34 546
   ```

1. RecursiveGCD

   Write a program that inputs two numbers and output its' [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor).
   You must write a recursive subroutine gcd to complete this task.

   Input:
   ```
   2467080
   49360080
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   9240
   ```

1. LeftDigits

   Write a program that inputs a cardinal N, an then inputs N numbers (may be negative).
   After that it outputs only first digits of these numbers (in one line).
   You are inclined to write a subroutine "first", that accepts a number (via $a0) and returns last digit (via $v0).

   Input:
   ```
   5
   -2345
   7345623
   -4321
   2 
   7543
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   27427
    ```

1. CubicRoot
1. FractionTruncate
1. LeibPi
1. ASCIIGrid
1. KeySort
1. ReverseString
1. CrtDraw
1. EightSectors
1. NoError
1. NotOval
